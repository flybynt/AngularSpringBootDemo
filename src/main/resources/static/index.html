</header>
<span>
This web full stack demo uses a REST API generated with Springboot using an H2 embedded database, which exposes the API using 
two popular Springboot approaches. The presentation portion of the demo is composed of an MVC Angular application that is 
intended to demonstrate the principals of client based MVC, responsive design, and accessibility semantics. The demo UI was tested 
with an LG3 smartphone, Kindle Fire tablet, and HP laptop using Chrome browser using both responsive and device simulation modes.
<br><br>The demo also demonstrates various methods to register event notifications that the current page has loaded which can be
used to bootstrap UI and app functionality. These techniques and or careful placement of scripts tags are used to ensure that the 
user experience is not greatly impacted during app loading and rendering. Processing of these event registration and notification 
techniques is demonstrated on this page.<br><br>The demo app can be accessed as individual page based applications or as a 
SPA (Single Page Application) utilizing angularJS routing. The same angularJS controllers are shared for both approaches.

<h2>Development Related Requirements</h2>
</header>
The primary requirements for the demo MVC app and REST API were set forth as follows
<br>
<br>
<header role="banner">
<h3>User Interface</h3>
</header>
<ul>
<li>Build a form that takes the customer name, email address and some free form comments</li>
<li>Must be a client side MVC based app (AngularJS or React)</li>
<li>Think about page HTML quality semantics (simplicity, page size, field names etc)</li>
<li>Apply some CSS to the HTML to allow for responsive design and common rendering across mobile devices and screen sizes</li>
<li>Show modularization of JS and framework code</li>
<li>When implementing form(s), ensure add some validation and field status</li>
<li>Ensure the page is developed with attention for Accessibility in mind for the disabled</li>
</ul>
<header role="banner">
<h3>REST API</h3>
</header>
<ul>
<li>Build a back-end REST API on the that receives the comments and info from the MVC app and writes them to sys out (obviously not production ready but for demo purpose!)</li>
<li>The API should validate comments, remove malicious characters as necessary before storing them</li>
<li>The API should implement some pre-defined max lengths (200 chars for the comments and 100 for other fields)</li>
<li>Email entry format semantics should be enforced for email entries so that they are validated before being stored</li>
<li>The API should respond with appropriate http SUCCESS and ERROR codes and messages which should be able to be written to the browser console by the MVC app</li>
<li>The end-points should be able to be accessed via clients other than your MVC app such as curl or any web browser</li>
</ul>
